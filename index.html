                <h3>Juan Pablo Duarte's life</h3>
                <p>
                    Juan Pablo Duarte (January 26, 1813 – July 15, 1876) was a military leader,
                    writer, activist, and nationalist politician who was the foremost of the founding
                    fathers of the Dominican Republic. As one of the most celebrated figures in Dominican history,
                    Duarte is considered a folk hero and revolutionary visionary in the modern Dominican Republic,
                    who along with military general Ramón Matías Mella and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez,
                    organized and promoted the Trinitario movement that eventually led to the Dominican revolt
                    and independence from Haitian rule in 1844 and the start of a Dominican War of Independence.

                    In 1842, Duarte became officer in the National Guard and a year later in 1843 he participated
                    in the "Reformist Revolution" against the dictatorship of Jean Pierre Boyer, who threatened 
                    to invade the western part of the island with the intention of unifying it. After the defeat
                    of Haitian President and the proclamation of Dominican independence in 1844, the Board formed 
                    to designate the first ruler of the nation and elected Duarte by a strong majority vote
                    to preside over the nation but he declined the proposal, while Tomás Bobadilla took 
                    office instead.

                    Duarte helped inspire and finance the Dominican War of Independence, paying a heavy toll
                    which would eventually ruin him financially. Duarte also disagreed strongly with royalist
                    and pro-annexation sectors in the nation, especially with the wealthy caudillo and military
                    strongman Pedro Santana, who sought to rejoin the Spanish Empire. From these struggles,
                    Santana emerged victorious while Duarte suffered in exile, living in Venezuela until his
                    death in 1876.
